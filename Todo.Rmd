## In Progress
- [x] [R Markdown, Bookdown and Knitr](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
- [x] Bibtex integration into R Markdown/Bookdown
- [ ] Factor away the lib file for unzipping data
- [ ] Convert run.r to an R Notebook
- [ ] Setup renv for project
- [ ] Setup targets for the project
- [ ] Implement  [knitr's code externalization](https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/externalization/) for `lib` and `run.r`

## Next 
- [ ] Bibtex references throughout R Markdown/Bookdown; Global option for bibliography?
- [ ] Identify periodic 'publication' documents needed on a project (e.g. Meeting Minutes/Outcomes, Work log, project metrics, etc)
- [ ] Reading List, reference groups, priorities and Bibtex
- [ ] Status update / report on current state of the project
- [ ] Read up on [Index of Dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_dispersion)
- [ ] Try and fit a hawkes process to our event data
- [ ] Explore histogram bin count to maximize delta between min and max count
- [ ] Calculate running msg queue size
- [ ] Normalize on Tidyverse libraries/packages
- [ ] Learn ggplot2

## Backlog
- [ ] Evaluate need for run time Data Provenance and appropriate tooling.
- [ ] Compared and evaluate R Project Directory structure models from Reproducible Research CRAN Task Group
- [ ] Documentation and Reporting Standard Operating Procedures for DS/ML Projects

## Done
- [x] Start outline of best practices, needs and methodologies
- [x] Reference Manager App Evaluations (Jabref, Mendeley, Zotero)
  - Mendeley seems to have been the one I've stuck with so far.
- [x] Evaluate and setup [DVC](dvc.org) for tracking/versioning data resources and history.
- [x] Setup basic Metalsmith static site generator.
  - Will probably let this go in favor of an R Markdown based solution.
