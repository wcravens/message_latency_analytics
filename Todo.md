# Todo

## In Progress
- [ ] [R Markdown, Bookdown and Knitr](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

## Imminent
- [ ] Bibtex integration into R Markdown/Bookdown
- [ ] Bibtex references throughout R Markdown/Bookdown
- [ ] Reading List, reference groups, priorities and Bibtex

## Backlog
- [ ] Evaluate need for run time Data Provenance and appropriate tooling.
- [ ] Compared and evaluate R Project Directory structure models from Reproducible Research CRAN Task Group
- [ ] Documentation and Reporting Standard Operating Procedures for DS/ML Projects

## Done
- [x] Start outline of best practices, needs and methodologies
- [x] Reference Manager App Evaluations (Jabref, Mendeley, Zotero)
  - Mendeley seems to have been the one I've stuck with so far.
- [x] Evaluate and setup [DVC](dvc.org) for tracking/versioning data resources and history.
- [x] Setup basic Metalsmith static site generator.
  - Will probably let this go in favor of an R Markdown based solution.
